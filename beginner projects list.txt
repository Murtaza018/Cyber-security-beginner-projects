Here are some beginner-level cybersecurity project ideas you can try, especially if you're just starting out. These are great for understanding basic security principles, learning common tools, and building your resume:



🔐 2. Simple Encryption/Decryption App
Goal: Build an app that uses basic encryption algorithms like Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, or XOR.

GUI or CLI version

Option to encrypt/decrypt a message

Explain how each algorithm works

🌐 3. Port Scanner
Goal: Scan open ports on a target IP to simulate basic reconnaissance.

Use Python (socket or nmap module)

Identify common open ports (e.g., 80, 443, 22)

Warn users about potentially exposed ports

🔍 4. Keylogger (for educational use only!)
Goal: Record keystrokes to understand how keyloggers work.

Use Python with the pynput library

Store keystrokes in a log file
⚠️ Use only on your own computer — this is for learning purposes.

📄 5. Phishing Awareness Webpage
Goal: Design a fake login page to teach users about phishing attacks.

Clone a basic login UI (e.g., Facebook or Gmail lookalike)

Educate users after they "submit" credentials

Explain what red flags they should watch out for

🧪 6. Basic Vulnerability Scanner
Goal: Create a scanner that checks websites for basic vulnerabilities.

Use Python and the requests or BeautifulSoup library

Check for:

Missing HTTPS

Outdated server headers

XSS or SQL injection test inputs

🧰 7. Firewall Rules Simulator
Goal: Simulate how firewall rules block or allow traffic.

Use basic CLI interface

Let users add/remove rules (IP, port, protocol)

Visualize what’s allowed or denied

👤 8. Social Engineering Awareness Quiz
Goal: Build a quiz app that teaches users about phishing, baiting, and other attacks.

Include real-life scenarios

Explain correct answers after each question
