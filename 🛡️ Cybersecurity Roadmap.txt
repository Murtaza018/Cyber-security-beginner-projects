Cybersecurity terminologies: vulnerability, threat, risk, exploit

Networking basics (OSI model, TCP/IP, ports, protocols)

Basics of Linux & Windows OS

🛠️ Tools:
VirtualBox / VMware (for setting up test labs)

Wireshark (network packet analysis)

Nmap (network scanning)

Windows PowerShell / Linux Bash

📚 Learn From:
Cybrary

TryHackMe – Complete Beginner

YouTube (e.g., NetworkChuck, The Cyber Mentor)

🏅 Optional Cert:
CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+)

Google Cybersecurity Certificate (Coursera)

🟡 2. Intermediate Level – Build Practical Skills
🧠 Topics:
Network Security

Operating System Security

Cryptography (symmetric, asymmetric, hashing)

Firewalls, VPNs, IDS/IPS

Web application security (OWASP Top 10)

Common tools: Metasploit, Burp Suite

🛠️ Tools:
Burp Suite (web app security testing)

Metasploit (exploitation framework)

Nessus / OpenVAS (vulnerability scanners)

Hashcat / John the Ripper (password cracking)

Kali Linux / Parrot OS

🧪 Practice Platforms:
TryHackMe – Junior Penetration Tester Path

Hack The Box

🏅 Certs:
CompTIA Security+ (great starting point)

eJPT (Junior Penetration Tester)

🟠 3. Advanced Level – Choose a Specialization
🔀 Specializations:
Penetration Testing / Ethical Hacking

Security Operations (SOC Analyst)

Digital Forensics / Incident Response

Malware Analysis / Reverse Engineering

Cloud Security

Red Team / Blue Team

🔧 Advanced Tools:
Splunk / ELK (SIEM)

Autopsy / FTK (Forensics)

Ghidra / IDA (Reverse engineering)

Snort / Suricata (IDS)

AWS / Azure / GCP (Cloud Security)

🧪 Practice:
CTF platforms (CTFtime, PicoCTF)

Red vs Blue Labs

Build your own Homelab

🏅 Recommended Certs (per path):
Role	Certification Example
